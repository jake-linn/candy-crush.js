# Candy-Crush! (sort of....)

For this project, I made a basic verison of the popular mobile game, candy crush. The goal of the game is to match same fruits in groups of 3 and 4 with the scroe increase with each correct match. While getting the images and grid set up was fairly easy, the bulk of the code goes into the logic of comparing similare and disimlar fruits and to check to matching rows and columns of 3 and 4. This project was made using react.js.
